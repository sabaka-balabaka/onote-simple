onote-simple 0.0.2

The simpliest private note software, writtent in Python, using flask framework, even
without a database backend. It authenticates users against plaintext user:password
text file, then, if auth is successful, shows message from a spool directory.
Applications contains basic protection algorythms, server-side form validation.
I created it to transmit some sensitive and valuable information to my partners,
and my family. I have connected to the Internet through VPN-Tor router, created
onion hidden service, and have mapped onion service local port to flask wsgi.
The goal was to make a solution mobile-friendly, and make it, so i will not require
ane dtptndencies on a recepient's smartphone, except TOR Browser.
Very simple, and very secure.
